# renameImgVidToDateTime
A simple python3 script to scan contents of working directory and rename images and videos to datetime. 
Does not support all image/video file types. It will skip any unsupported files. Mostly used for PNGs and JPEGs.


# Usage:
1) Have Python3 components installed. (Check the imports.)
2) Place the script inside the folder containing the images and videos.
3) Linux: Give the script permissions for the folder.
4) Run script inside the containing folder from terminal: ```python3 renameImgVidToDateTime.py```
5) Review terminal for any issues.


# recursive_renameImgVidToDateTime
A similar script, but remade entirely for moving recursively through all directories. 
**Use at your own risk! Only place this at the root of a folder with your images and videos!**
